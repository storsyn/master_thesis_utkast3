	abstract = {People spend a large portion of time at their workplace and henceforth, need actions to recharge their mind and body. Therefore, it is important to highlight on health promotion activities in the workplace that focus on changing personal health behaviours such as diet. Research has revealed that physical activities increase work efficiency [1] and planned naps taken during work keep suitable levels of waking function for day-time and night-time work [2]. Most relevant research has been done without considering the theoretical concept and empirical approach. This study aims to develop persuasive applications incorporating psychological theories to combine these implicit measures such as consuming a healthy diet, physical activity and napping at the workplace. The quantitative and qualitative approach will be used to empirically measuring the effectiveness of the applications in the context of employees' health behaviour change. It is hoped that users will benefit from improved health using the applications.},

The sample consisted of 2709 females and 2212 men in the age groups 75, 60, 45, 40 and 30 years. Questionnaires measured barriers to engagement in physical activity, engagement in physical activity and readiness for engaging in physical activity (stages of change). Multivariate analyses of variance demonstrated significant age and gender differences in the perceptions of barriers at the various stages of change. The logistic regressions [estimated odds ratios (OR)] demonstrated that low scores for affective/cognitive and practical barriers were significantly associated with higher OR for engagement in physical activity for women, and low-priority barriers and lower age were associated with higher OR for being physically active for men. The information from this study should be valuable for designing and tailoring both motivational strategies and interventions to fit targeted groups.},

	abstract = {Background
Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide an opportunity for easy, just-in-time access to health promotion and self-management support. However, poor user engagement with these apps remains a significant unresolved challenge.

Objective
This study aimed to assess the effect of sending versus not sending a push notification containing a contextually tailored health message on proximal engagement, measured here as self-monitoring via the app. Secondary aims were to examine whether this effect varies by the number of weeks enrolled in the program or by weekday versus weekend. An exploratory aim was to describe how the effect on proximal engagement differs between weekday versus weekend by the time of day.

Methods
The study analyzes the causal effects of push notifications on proximal engagement in 1255 users of a commercial workplace well-being intervention app over 89 days. The app employs a microrandomized trial (MRT) design to send push notifications. At 1 of 6 times per day (8:30 am, 12:30 pm, 5:30 pm, 6:30 pm, 7:30 pm, and 8:30 pm; selected randomly), available users were randomized with equal probability to be sent or not sent a push notification containing a tailored health message. The primary outcome of interest was whether the user self-monitored behaviors and feelings at some time during the next 24 hours via the app. A generalization of log-linear regression analysis, adapted for use with data arising from an MRT, was used to examine the effect of sending a push notification versus not sending a push notification on the probability of engagement over the next 24 hours.

Results
Users were estimated to be 3.9\% more likely to engage with the app in the next 24 hours when a tailored health message was sent versus when it was not sent (risk ratio 1.039; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.08; P{\textless}.05). The effect of sending the message attenuated over the course of the study, but this effect was not statistically significant (P=.84). The effect of sending the message was greater on weekends than on weekdays, but the difference between these effects was not statistically significant (P=.18). When sent a tailored health message on weekends, the users were 8.7\% more likely to engage with the app (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.17), whereas on weekdays, the users were 2.5\% more likely to engage with the app (95\% CI 0.98 to 1.07). The effect of sending a tailored health message was greatest at 12:30 pm on weekends, when the users were 11.8\% more likely to engage (90\% CI 1.02 to 1.13).

Conclusions
Sending a push notification containing a tailored health message was associated with greater engagement in an mHealth app. Results suggested that users are more likely to engage with the app within 24 hours when push notifications are sent at mid-day on weekends.},

Using a design science research approach, we develop the Digital Nudge Design method and evaluate its applicability and usefulness in practice. The method is based on requirements deduced from literature on digital nudging and persuasive systems and frominterviews with practitioners from five case organizations. The study contributes to research that seeks to develop methods for influential user interface design, and the method supports researchers and practitioners in designing digital nudges.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.1138},
	abstract = {Background
 Health behavior interventions using periodic prompts have utilized technology, such as the Internet, that allows messages to be sent to participants in cost-effective ways. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evidence review has been performed specifically to evaluate the effectiveness of communicating regular messages and to examine how characteristics of the prompts change the effectiveness of programs aimed at reminding people to adopt healthy behaviors, maintain those they already practice, and cease unhealthy behaviors.

Objective
 A systematic literature review was performed to investigate the effectiveness of limited contact interventions targeting weight loss, physical activity, and/or diet that provided periodic prompts regarding behavior change for health promotion. The review sought to identify specific characteristics of these interventions that may be associated with superior results.

Methods
 Electronic literature searches were performed between February and April, 2008. Articles were included if periodic prompts were used as an intervention or a component of an intervention, a behavioral or biological outcome measure was used, and an ongoing health promotion behavior was targeted. A rating system was applied to each study to provide a quantitative representation of the quality of the evidence provided by each article.

Results
 There were 19 articles with a combined sample size of 15,655 that met the inclusion criteria, and 11 studies reported positive findings regarding the utility of periodic prompts. Several articles showed enhanced effectiveness when prompts were frequent and personal contact with a counselor was included. Long-term behavior change and health improvements were not examined by this review because of a lack of long-term follow-up in the literature.

Conclusions
 In light of promising results of most studies, additional research on limited contact interventions targeting health behaviors including weight loss, physical activity, and/or diet is merited that utilizes rigorous methods including control groups; follow-up data collection; and testing of prompt frequencies, specific intervention components, or prompt characteristics. Future research would be especially valuable if it improves understanding of the most effective types of periodic prompts for fostering long-term behavior change in order to maximize use of this tool in limited contact health promotion programs. Specifically, various types of communication technology should be used and evaluated to expand and refine their use.},

The usual route to behaviour change in economics and psychology has been to attempt to ‘change minds’ by influencing the way people think through information and incentives. There is, however, increasing evidence to suggest that ‘changing contexts’ by influencing the environments within which people act (in largely automatic ways) can have important effects on behaviour. We present a mnemonic, MINDSPACE, which gathers up the nine most robust effects that influence our behaviour in mostly automatic (rather than deliberate) ways. This framework is being used by policymakers as an accessible summary of the academic literature.

	abstract = {Because of the increasing dependency on online technologies in even the most ordinary activities, people have to make privacy decisions during everyday online interactions. Visual design often influences their choices. Hence, it is in the hands of choice architects and designers to guide users towards specific decision outcomes. This “nudging” has gained much interest among scholars in interdisciplinary research, resulting in experimental studies with visual cues that may have the potential to alter attitudes and behaviors. Attitude and behavior changes are often attributed to several psychological effects manifesting in cognitive processing and decision-making. This article presents the results of a systematic literature review carried out to identify which psychological effects have been previously studied in the context of online privacy interactions. Subsequently, fifteen articles were selected and thoroughly reviewed, resulting in the identification of twenty psychological effects. The visual cues triggering these effects were recognized and classified against their capabilities to alter privacy attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, the visual cues were divided into two categories: privacy-enhancing and privacy-deteriorating. This review discusses the applicability of such cues in research and UI design. Further, the findings are discussed against the existing research on digital nudges. The authors conclude with a discussion on issues of research quality in the privacy-related field and outline the road to improvement.},

Specifically, we tested whether (as predicted by HSM) signs that encourage heuristic processing (“Take the Stairs”) would have greatest impact when placed at the stair/escalator point of choice (when processing time is limited), whereas signs that encourage systematic processing (“Will You Take the Stairs?”) would have greatest impact when placed at some distance from the point of choice (when processing time is less limited). We also tested whether (as predicted by SDT) messages promoting autonomy would be more likely to result in sustained motivated behavior (i.e., stair taking at subsequent uncued choice points) than messages that use commands. A series of studies involving more than 9,000 pedestrians provided support for these predictions.},

In this study, we want to focus on IS-induced human behavior by introducing a process model for nudging in IS. In behavioral economics, the concept of nudging has been proposed, which makes use of human cognitive processes and can direct people to an intended behavior. In computer science, the concept of persuasion has evolved with similar goals. Both concepts, nudging and persuasion, can contribute to IS research and may help to explain and steer user behavior in information systems. We aim for an integration of both concepts into one digital nudging process model, making it usable and accessible. We analyzed literature on nudging and persuasion and derived different steps, requirements, and nudging elements. The developed process model aims at enabling researchers and practitioners to design nudges in e.g. software systems but may also contribute to other areas like IT governance. Though the evaluation part of our study has not yet been completed, we present the current state of the process model enabling more research in this area.},

The obtained results also provide practical guidance for automatic tailoring of persuasive Web pages about prevention topics, suggesting a strategy based on gender, an information about the user that is typically readily available in social network profiles, and other Web sites to which people register.},

	abstract = {Decisions are influenced by the environment in which the choices are presented. In fact, no choice is made in a vacuum, as there is no neutral way to present choices. Presenting choices in certain ways, even unintentionally, can “nudge” people to change their behavior in predictable ways. “Nudging” is a concept from behavioral economics that describes how even minor changes to decision environments (e.g., setting defaults) can influence decision outcomes—typically without the decision-maker noticing this influence. The more decisions people make using digital devices, the more the software engineer becomes a choice architect who knowingly or unknowingly influences people’s decisions. Thus, we extend the nudging concept to the digital environment, defining “digital nudging” as the use of user-interface design elements to guide people’s behavior in digital choice environments, and present a digital nudge design process to help online choice architects take nudging principles into consideration when designing digital choice environments like Web sites and apps.},

	abstract = {Physical inactivity is the main cause for most cardiovascular diseases as well as premature mortality in the Western world. Prevention may include changing people's behavior and encouraging them for a physically active way of life. Smartphones as our daily companions have a huge potential to influence the behavior of non-movers and to integrate physical activities into their daily routine. In this paper, we present a typology of mobile application features to change the sedentary behavior of non-movers. The features are characterized based on how they are useful in the behavior change process and on the psychological factors they address. Research is therefore based on two psychological models: The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change and Fogg's Behavior Model. Both models are combined to explain the theoretical aspects of health and fitness applications. We propose a new theoretical model how to support physical activity with mobile services and come up with propositions for this theoretical model. The Delphi technique is used as an empirical research method to summarize 30 mobile application features from domain experts. There are two major results: First, the consulted experts reveal what kind of intervention strategies are suitable in order to promote physical activity. Second, the study brings forth how the application features carry out support for behavior change. According to the user's motivational stage and the user's psychological characteristics, application features are assigned to different user types to support and increase physical activity.},

	abstract = {Behavioural interventions that directly influence decision-making are increasingly popular policy tools. Two prominent interventions used are nudges, which promote an optimal choice without restricting options, and boosts, which promote individual capabilities to make more informed choices. Direct comparison is a critical step toward understanding the populations and contexts where they may be most efficient, or potentially complementary toward improving their effectiveness. Two trials in the US and Serbia (N = 1423) tested a series of choices under uncertainty using both nudge and boost interventions. In a replication setting, hypothetical and consequential decisions are used. Findings indicate that disclosure nudges and boosts, unlike social nudges, promote more advantageous financial decisions. Furthermore, the effects of disclosure nudges and boosts generally differ depending on loss and gain framing—boosts promoted more advantageous decisions under gain frames while disclosure nudges did so under loss frames. Finally, boosts were typically more effective for those who initially made suboptimal choices and sociodemographic factors did not mediate the effectiveness of the interventions. These insights provide clarity to highly nuanced, complex patterns across population behaviours in the context of financial choice under uncertainty and considerable implications for the design of interventions for policies that impact population behaviours.},

	abstract = {It is a well known fact that user-chosen passwords are somewhat predictable: by using tools such as dictionaries or probabilistic models, attackers and password recovery tools can drastically reduce the number of attempts needed to guess a password. Quite surprisingly, however, existing literature does not provide a satisfying answer to the following question: given a number of guesses, what is the probability that a state-of-the-art attacker will be able to break a password? To answer the former question, we compare and evaluate the effectiveness of currently known attacks using various datasets of known passwords. We find that a "diminishing returns" principle applies: in the absence of an enforced password strength policy, weak passwords are common; on the other hand, as the attack goes on, the probability that a guess will succeed decreases by orders of magnitude. Even extremely powerful attackers won't be able to guess a substantial percentage of the passwords. The result of this work will help in evaluating the security of authentication means based on user- chosen passwords, and our methodology for estimating password strength can be used as a basis for creating more effective proactive password checkers for users and security auditing tools for administrators.},

In our methods, a service provider challenges the user with an image password. To determine the appropriate click points and their order, the user needs some hint information transmitted only to her handheld device. We show that our method can overcome threats such as key-loggers, weak password, and shoulder surfing. With the increasing popularity of handheld devices such as cell phones, our approach can be leveraged by many organizations without forcing the user to memorize different passwords or carrying around different tokens.},

One of the main reason for this weakness is due to the password leak phenomena. For several reasons (described in this paper) password databases are frequently leaked and shared publicly. Once these passwords it will be very hard for a user to protect his digital life, especially if this password is used in several websites (what we call domino effect). In this paper we propose a solution to reduce the attempts for replaying stolen passwords.

	abstract = {A graphical password is an authentication system that works by having the user select from images, in a specific order, presented in a graphical user interface (GUI). For this reason, the graphical-password approach is called graphical user authentication (GUA). The most common computer authentication method is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. This method has been shown to have significant disadvantages. For e.g, users tend to choose passwords that can be easily guessed. On the other hand, if a password is difficult to guess, then it is often difficult to remember. To overcome this problem of low security, Authentication methods are developed by researchers that use images as password. In this research paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the existing graphical password techniques and provide a possible theory of our own. Graphical password schemes have been proposed as a possible alternative to text-based schemes, by the fact that humans can remember pictures better than text; Pictures are generally easier to be remembered or recognized than text.},

	abstract = {Password-composition policies are the result of service providers becoming increasingly concerned about the security of online accounts. These policies restrict the space of user-created passwords to preclude easily guessed passwords and thus make passwords more difficult for attackers to guess. However, many users struggle to create and recall their passwords under strict password-composition policies, for example, ones that require passwords to have at least eight characters with multiple character classes and a dictionary check. Recent research showed that a promising alternative was to focus policy requirements on password length instead of on complexity. In this work, we examine 15 password policies, many focusing on length requirements. In doing so, we contribute the first thorough examination of policies requiring longer passwords. We conducted two online studies with over 20,000 participants, and collected both usability and password-strength data. Our findings indicate that password strength and password usability are not necessarily inversely correlated: policies that lead to stronger passwords do not always reduce usability. We identify policies that are both more usable and more secure than commonly used policies that emphasize complexity rather than length requirements. We also provide practical recommendations for service providers who want their users to have strong yet usable passwords.},

One of the greatest challenges today is that the average user has about 40 personal and professional accounts that rely on user names and passwords for authentication. These logins are rarely unique, hardly ever changed, oftentimes simplistic, and rely on insecure "security questions" fallback options because they are regularly forgotten and reset [1]. The past few years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of data breaches of major corporations and government agencies and that number only continues to grow. These significant breaches make it now more important than ever to find some new ways to access private data. In order for us to stay safe and secure online, we must look at emerging technologies to conceptualize the future of login authentication. From biometrics to sound-based passwords to electronic tattoos and ingestible pills, the future holds numerous ways for us to interact with our machines in a safer and more efficient manner than ever before.},

In this paper, we analyze 12,000 passwords collected under seven composition policies via an online study. We develop an efficient distributed method for calculating how effectively several heuristic password-guessing algorithms guess passwords. Leveraging this method, we investigate (a) the resistance of passwords created under different conditions to guessing, (b) the performance of guessing algorithms under different training sets, (c) the relationship between passwords explicitly created under a given composition policy and other passwords that happen to meet the same requirements, and (d) the relationship between guess ability, as measured with password-cracking algorithms, and entropy estimates.

Auditing results can proactively indicate if weak passwords exist in an organization, decreasing the risks of compromisation. Password cracking is a typical and timeconsuming way to perform password auditing. Given that defenders perform password auditing within a specific evaluation timeframe, the cracking process needs to be optimized to yield useful results. Existing password cracking tools do not provide holistic features to optimize the process. Therefore, the need arises to build new password auditing toolkits to assist defenders to achieve their task in an effective and efficient way. Moreover, to maximize the benefits of password auditing, a security policy should be utilized. Currently the efforts focus on the specification of password security policies, providing rules on how to construct passwords. This work proposes the functionality that should be supported by next-generation password auditing toolkits and provides guidelines to drive the specification of a relevant password auditing policy.},

Participants suggested several tools for meeting their healthcare needs, including: reminders/alerts, lab results tracking, and notes on health status. mHealth technology can function as a social actor by providing chat boxes/forums, testimonials of lived experiences, and personal outreach. Examples of media that can be used as a persuasive technology include games/virtual rewards, coding of health tasks, and simulations on how to connect with PLWH. Findings from these focus groups can be used to design a mobile app for PLWH that is targeted to meet their healthcare needs.},

We applied three behavioral economics persuasion techniques—the default option strategy, the planning strategy, and the asymmetric choice strategy—to promote healthy snacking in the workplace. We tested the strategies in three experimental case studies using a human snack deliverer, a robot, and a snack ordering website. The default and the planning strategies were effective, but they worked differently depending on whether the participants had healthy dietary lifestyles or not.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION Although the benefits of physical activity and exercise are widely acknowledged, many middle-aged and elderly individuals remain sedentary. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the external and internal barriers to physical activity and exercise participation among middle-aged and elderly individuals, as well as identify any differences in these barriers between the two groups. METHODS Recruited individuals were categorised into either the middle-aged (age 45-59 years, n = 60) or elderly (age ≥ 60 years, n = 60) group. Data on demographics, anthropometry, as well as external and internal barriers to participation in physical activity and exercise were collected. RESULTS Analysis showed no significant differences in the total scores of all internal barriers between the two groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The total scores for most external barriers between the two groups also showed no significant differences (p {\textgreater} 0.05); only 'cost' (p = 0.045) and 'exercise interferes with social/family activities' (p = 0.011) showed significant differences. The most common external barriers among the middle-aged and elderly respondents were 'not enough time' (46.7\% vs. 48.4\%), 'no one to exercise with' (40.0\% vs. 28.3\%) and 'lack of facilities' (33.4\% vs. 35.0\%). The most common internal barriers for middle-aged respondents were 'too tired' (48.3\%), 'already active enough' (38.3\%), 'do not know how to do it' (36.7\%) and 'too lazy' (36.7\%), while those for elderly respondents were 'too tired' (51.7\%), 'lack of motivation' (38.4\%) and 'already active enough' (38.4\%). CONCLUSION Middle-aged and elderly respondents presented with similar external and internal barriers to physical activity and exercise participation. These factors should be taken into account when healthcare policies are being designed and when interventions such as the provision of facilities to promote physical activity and exercise among older people are being considered.},

	abstract = {Objectives To assess the feasibility in routine primary care consultation and investigate the effect on risk recall and self-management of a new type of risk communication intervention based on behavioural economics (“nudge-based”) for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Forty adults with poorly controlled T2DM (HbA1c {\textgreater} 7.5\%) were randomized to receive a personalized, nudge-based risk communication intervention (n = 20) or standard care (n = 20). Risk recall and self-management were evaluated at baseline and 12 weeks after the intervention. Results Both in terms of feasibility and acceptability, this new risk communication intervention was very satisfactory. Study retention rate after 12 weeks was very high (90\%) and participants were highly satisfied with the intervention (4.4 out of 5 on the COMRADE scale). Although not powered to identify significant between-group effects, the intervention significantly improved risk recall after 12 weeks and intentions to make lifestyle changes (dietary behaviour) compared to standard care. Conclusions This pilot study provides the first evidence of the feasibility of implementing in primary care a nudge-based risk communication intervention for people with T2DM. Based on the promising results observed, an adequately powered trial to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on long-term self-management is judged feasible. As a result of this feasibility study, some minor adaptations to the intervention and study methods that would help to facilitate a definitive trial are also reported.},

Persuasive design and digital nudging refer to two design strategies, which both emphasize the concept of designing with intention. By guiding users through design within the process of decision-making. Digital nudging originates from the concept of nudging which is rarely mentioned in the online context or in the field of IS. In this case, the concept of digital nudging is a way to bridge the relationship between nudging and IS. Consequently, this study will allow digital nudging to be introduced into the area of study, through the lens of persuasive design. To support the investigation, the separate design principles regarding persuasive design and digital nudging was merged into the intersection model, which acted as a foundation towards the research. The research was conducted by a hybrid inspection method. The outcome of the evaluation demonstrates that persuasive design and digital nudging have the ability to complement and enrich each other, through six separate intersection principles. (Less)},

We report the distribution of the studies across countries, years, domains, subdomains of applicability, intervention types, and the moderators associated with each intervention category to review the current state of the nudge movement. Furthermore, we highlight certain characteristics of the studies and experimental and reporting practices that can hinder the accumulation of evidence in the field. Specifically, we found that 74\% of the studies were mainly motivated to assess the effectiveness of the interventions in one specific setting, while only 24\% of the studies focused on the exploration of moderators or underlying processes. We also observed that only 7\% of the studies applied power analysis, 2\% used guidelines aiming to improve the quality of reporting, no study in our database was preregistered, and the used intervention nomenclatures were non-exhaustive and often have overlapping categories. Building on our current observations and proposed solutions from other fields, we provide directly applicable recommendations for future research to support the evidence accumulation on why and when nudges work.

In this paper we present a systematic review of the use of nudging in HCI research with the goal of laying out the design space of technology-mediated nudging - the why (i.e., which cognitive biases do nudges combat) and the how (i.e., what exact mechanisms do nudges employ to incur behavior change). All in all, we found 23 distinct mechanisms of nudging, grouped in 6 categories, and leveraging 15 different cognitive biases. We present these as a framework for technology-mediated nudging, and discuss the factors shaping nudges' effectiveness and their ethical implications.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of nudge activities at school on the students’ body mass index (BMI).

Design:
School-based factorial randomized community trial.

Setting:
Eighteen public schools in the municipality of Duque de Caxias, metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Participants and intervention:
The 18 schools will be randomized into 4 group arms: group 1—control (without any activity); group 2—will receive educational activities in the classroom; group 3—will receive changes in the school environment (nudge strategies); group 4—will receive educational activities and changes in the school environment. Activities will occur during the 2018 school-year.

Main outcome measure(s):
The primary (BMI) and secondary (body fat percentage) outcomes will be assessed at baseline and after the study using a portable electronic scale with a segmental body composition monitor. The height will be measured by a portable stadiometer.

Analysis:
Statistical analyses for each outcome will be conducted through linear mixed models that took into account the missing data and cluster effect of the schools.},

To help individuals avoid regrettable online disclosures, we employed lessons from behavioral decision research and research on soft paternalism to design mechanisms that "nudge" users to consider the content and context of their online disclosures before posting them. We developed three such privacy nudges on Facebook. The first nudge provides visual cues about the audience for a post. The second nudge introduces time delays before a post is published. The third nudge gives users feedback about their posts. We tested the nudges in a three-week exploratory field trial with 21 Facebook users, and conducted 13 follow-up interviews.

However, effects of nudges are limited to local maxima, as they are almost always designed with the “average” person in mind, instead of being customized to different individuals. Such “nudge personalization” has been advocated before, but its actual potency and feasibility has never been systematically investigated. Using the ubiquitous domain of online password nudges as our testbed, we present a novel approach that utilizes people’s decision-making style to personalize the online nudge they receive. In two large-scale studies, we show how and when personalized nudges can lead to considerably stronger and more secure passwords, compared to administering “one-size-fits-all” nudges. We discuss the implications of these findings and how more efforts by researchers and policy-makers should and could be made to guarantee that each individual is nudged in a way most right for them.},

However, it is arguable whether the explosion of available information helps or hinders decision making, including in important domains such as healthcare and sustainability. Improving on that is the domain of choice architecture, intended to provide decision-knowledge through understanding choice-implications and so guiding actions in effective and ethical directions (i.e. 'nudging'). Social media has largely evolved as the significant means of choice architecture, but the question remains as to whether decisions based on it are truly effective and ethical, or attracted toward social norms that reinforce poor judgment. This paper explores those issues, including how technologies can be shaped to improve decision-making, and how academic models can be used to nudge toward improved norms.},

However, personalization seems to be hard to apply. Some of these problems are caused by the fact that personalization means something different to each business and to the different actors in the value chain. This lack of agreement regarding the meaning of personalization limits successful communication between the different actors who produce or buy services and products that are connection with personalized marketing. This hinders co‐operation between service providers and marketers who are willing to apply personalization., – It is hoped that the framework is useful when discussing and developing the idea of personalization further.},

To examine this trade-off, we first identified benefits and costs of personalization based on the findings of qualitative interviews. Next, we conducted a quantitative survey to assess the risks people perceive for various data types and illustrate how people's general attitudes toward personal data sharing determines their perceptions of benefits and costs of personalization.},

Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computer-human dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two technologies were combined to create personalized and persuasive systems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the users being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased success, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques. Hence, the coupling of personalization and persuasion has the potential to enhance the impact of both technologies. This new, developing area clearly offers mutual benefits to both research areas, as we illustrate in this special issue.},
