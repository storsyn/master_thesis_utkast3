%Insert an abstract here.
Physical inactivity is one of the main factors for cardiovascular and non transmittable diseases in the world. In Norway, 70 percent does not follow the recommendations for governments (Helsedirektoratet). The utilization of technology and design, are important tools for reducing the numbers for physical inactivity. Personal Informatics (PI) and Persuasive Technology (PT) such as applications to monitor and motivate for physical activity becomes promising. Nudging is a term that has emerged from behavioral economics, and means ... As computer became commonplace, nudging was inherited to digital interfaces as well.  

 Digital nudge interventions have gained little attention when it comes to  user experience and perception, at least for physical activity promotion. Most studies regarding physical activity present measured efficiency through quantitative data and statistics (finne ut om dette gjelder bare for fysisk aktivitet eller DN generelt?)

Many nudging techniques have been identified, and there are therefore numerous ways to implement them. The question "how to nudge" remain unanswered. Many studies suggest that tailoring is a promising direction (hva grunnlag har de til å si at tailoring er så viktig hvis de ikke har gjort kvalitative stuider?? Finne kilder).
