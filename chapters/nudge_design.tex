\section{Development of Digital Nudges} 
Explain how the digital nudges that were tested were designed:
I followed the DND method (Mirshc et al. 2018) when developing the digital nudges. 
Also got inspiration from earlier studies, conducting similar studies. 

This chapter is devoted to describe the design process of the digital nudges that are investigated in this research. 

For the development of the digital nudges investigated in this study, the DND method by Mircsh et al. was used for inspiration and guiding, meaning that is was partly applied / followed loosely. As this is not an evaluation of the DND method itself, but rather to get some guidance on how to decide for what to test. 

This method consist of three phases: analysing, designing and evaluation. the last phase suggest that one should evaluate the design intervention does not fulfill the desired effects, I will not use perform iterative process, as the evaluation part is what my study focuses at. 

\textbf{Timing and Frequency }
Due to the scope of this master thesis / research, timing and frequency, has not been deeply/widely considered when designing these digital nudges.  That is to say, there was chosen three different times during a day and , during one month the participants were supposed to receive 16 nudges in total. Randomly distributed during the 30 days trial.
