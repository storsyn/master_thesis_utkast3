\section{Methodology}
%Qualitative data can contribute to increased knowledge about how we should design digital nudges for physical activity promotion. Through a qualitative data (collected during interviews), I want to disclose how we should consider framing when it comes to designing digital nudges in this given context. 

%This study follows an exploratory and qualitative research approach, as we are trying to understand "why" people has certain perceptions about the digital nudge interface. It uses primary data, collected through a qualitative research method (semi-structured interviews).

%Methodological approach: basic, exploratory and qualitative. 

%As the proposed research question for this study - “RQ1” - aims at understanding user's perception and experience of the given digital nudge user interface, (in order to gather insight on how to tailor the digital nudge to be more effective), it would be reasonable to follow a qualitative research approach.

%Interviews has the advantage of being changeable and dynamic, meaning that it allows follow-up questions where unpredictable directions occur. It provides a more detailed dataset than for instance surveys do. It is also possible to converse with several participants at the same time, called focus groups, but there is a risk that participants will be influenced by each other’s responses. 

To answer the addressed research questions, a qualitative and exploratory research approach was applied. In collaboration with SATS, there was conducted a two-week-trial/intervention with digital nudging for physical activity promotion on participants at a fitness center. Followed by data collection of user experience and perceived effect of these digital nudges was collected through interviews. 
We are trying to understand "how" people perceive the digital nudge interface/implementation and "why" (which factors influence the perception) they perceive that way.  

%Data regarding the users experience and perceived effect of these digital nudges was collected through a semi-structured interview. 

\section{Data Collection}
    \subsection{Semi-structured interview}
    %Why did you choose semi-structured interview?
    Interviews are an flexible way to collect data, as it one can get both the in depth answers and more of a quantitative measurements (such as prior activity frequency before the nudge intervention, type of motivation, etc). Semi-structured interviews was conducted for this study, and the researcher has a set of predefined topics and questions, which will act as a guide to ensure that the same overall topics is reviewed for each interview. The researcher determines to what extent it is useful to follow the guide during the interviews.
     We applied open-ended questions to get a detailed and comprehensive picture on the user's experience. It was crucial to ask appropriate follow-up questions where necessary to capture important information. It can be challenging to conduct, especially for novice researchers, as it is very important that the interviewer does not provide guidance for the interview objects. 
     
    \subsection{Participants and Recruitment}
\textbf{Target population and study sample}

\textbf{Sample Size} 
 We were able to conduct 22 interviews, which we considered suitable, as this is an exploratory study of a certain implementation of a digital nudge interface, which aims to investigate users perception and experience. 

\textbf{Sampling technique /Recruitment}
%Sampling means how the data sources was chosen whilst recruitment means how it was actually performed(?)
    
    The study is limited to investigating how individuals with ability and motivation for physical activity (apparently), experience and perceive the digital nudges for physical activity. Hence, the sampling was non-randomized.
    
    Recruitment: 
    
     %The easiest way to get in touch with the target population (individuals who have expressed ability and motivation for physical activity through membership in the training center) was to attend on some training centers. 
     The recruitment was done by standing at various SATS training centers in Oslo and actively recruiting people for the digital nudge trial / intervention. Information sheets was distributed, and consents where collected. In addition it was made sure that everyone signing up to participate had enabled push notifications through their app. In total, 105 participants registered to be a part of the study. Even though everyone agreed to take part in the following interview, we knew from experience from other research, that the actual participation rate is not very high. For that reason, we wanted to recruit as many participants as possible over a time period. 
        
    As the study followed an exploratory approach, it was also nice to have a good selection of participants, if it should be necessary to group/sort/filter them more.

    \subsection{Data Collection Procedure}
    In the following sections I will describe how I proceeded the process of data collection. // A step by step description of data collection procedures will follow. 
    
        \subsubsection{Preparations}
        %nsd, samtykkeskjema, definere intervju, velge ut objeter, framdriftsplan 
        
        There are strict rules regarding data processing and data storage in research, due to privacy. As this project deals with personal information and also what goes under the category of health information, it had to be reported to NSD, Norwegian Centre of Research Data, where it was approved. 

        In collaboration with NSD I formed a “information sheet” (see Appendix B) about the research was handed out to all participants, and the “statement of consent” was signed in order to give their consent. 
        
        %Neste steg, etter å ha laget informasjonsskriv og samtykkeskjema er jo rekruttering, som beskrevet ovenfor(?)
        
        
        \subsubsection{Interview Guide}
        For conducting semi-structured interviews, an interview guide is helpful. Different questions and topics was constructed, and the guide was reviewed by my supervisor and other acquaintances who could contribute a neutral view of the questions. 
        
        \subsubsection{Pilot Interview}
        Before starting the interview process, a pilot test of the interview guide was conducted to ensure that the right questions were asked in the right manner, and that  it managed to get useful / promising data from the participants. Pilot testing plays an important role when doing qualitative studies, as one should ensure that all questions are understandable and clear to the participants, whether it comes to surveys or interviews (Reference: Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd Edition, 2017). Questions and topics that appeared to be irrelevant was removed, and biased or ambiguous questions were changed to a more neutral and clear manner. For inexperienced / novice researchers, a pilot interview may also help to become more confident and comfortable in the new role as the interviewer. In addition, the pilot testing also gave an approximately estimation of how long time one interview would take. 
        
        \subsubsection{Interview Execution}
        In order to exploit the full potential of the interview it would have been preferred / beneficial to execute the interviews in physical appearance. Face-to-face interviews would give the opportunity to more easily capture the user's feelings, moods and opinions by reading body language and other subtle hints in an active dialog. Due to the corona pandemic and government intervention, it was not possible to conduct the interviews this way.  Instead, the interview was executed using different video calling tools (WhatsApp and FaceTime). The interviews were conducted within April 2020. 
        
        For the execution of interviews there are several considerations to be aware of. To get the most out of each interview object, one should ensure that the participant feel comfortable, safe and relaxed in the situation. When the interviews are conducted using technology tools it can generate new challenges. For some people, having to use technology in order to participate might be just another barrier to actually participate in the interview, whilst for other see it as lower threshold participating. Hence, the technology tool for video calling was made on participant's premise. 

\section{Data Analysis}
    \subsection{Thematic Analysis}
    %What is thematic analysis? And why did you choose it? maks 2 sider
    A structured way to do this (what?) is through thematic analysis, a method that is often used in psychology related research when looking at qualitative data. 
    
    When following a thematic analysis approach several choices needs to be considered and discussed, according to Braun and Clark (Reference: Using Thematic Analysis in Psychology, 2006). 
  
    Når det kommer til å identifisere tema blant kodene, kan det gjøres på to ulike måter. Latent (tolkende), som betyr at man må tolke hva man tror deltakeren mener med det den sier.  Semtanktisk (eksplisitt), som betyr at man skal holde seg til akkurat det de sier. En latent tilnærming ble fulgt ettersom...

    A thematic analysis means... 
    
    \subsection{Data Analysis Procedure}
    There are usually six stages of a thematic analysis: 1) familiarization with data, 2) coding, 3) generating themes, 4)Reviewing themes, 5) defining and naming themes and 6) produce the report.
    
    The following paragraph will present the phases of the thematic analysis that was conducted. 
    
    \subsubsection{Preparations}
    The verbal data was transcribed during the interview due to the limitations and lack of tools and resources. Due to this, the process around generating follow-up questions was a bit delayed and weakened. The risk about transcribing simultaneously with interviewing, is that it can be easy to miss things, however this was the best alternative pga øknimiske svakehteene / in this case. Directly after each interview, there was spent a good deal of time going through the interview to correct the typos and make the sentences complete. After all interviews were conducted and transcripted, the above-mentioned steps of thematic analysis was followed // used as inspiration, however, some adjustments were made. A description follows. 

\textbf{Defining user groups}
    Generating user groups based on different characteristics in the dataset: Various groupings were generated amongst the participants. As there was great variation among participants (representative selection), it was interesting to define some groups (consisting of individuals with the same variables / characteristics) to see if there was any correlation between their opinions, experiences and perceptions. The participants were grouped on variables such as: prior activity frequency, type of motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic), age.
    Age: The variation in the age of the participants was slightly skewed: more young than older people. In the age group of "20-30 years", there were 16 participants, whilst in the age group "30+ years" there were only 6. Therefore it is not possible to generalize findings around the age group, but we have nevertheless taken that into account.
    Type of motivation:
    Prior level: 
    
    \subsubsection{1. Familiarization}
    The first step of a thematic analysis is all about getting familiar with the dataset. The interviews was read and re-read several times, ensuring an overview of the dataset as a whole, and as independent materials, before starting the coding. During this phase, notes were taken (but not in a very structured manner) in order to have some ideas about what the data provides and why it is interesting before coding starts. 
    
    \subsubsection{2. Coding}
    Coding is the process of marking your data with labels and categorises that explains and summarises what the data represents (Reference: Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd Edition, Chapter 11. part 11.4.1). This can be done in many ways, for example through using tools and software. The data was coded manually as this allows for a more focus on the researcher... Phrases from the raw data (interview data) which describes an idea, opinion, experience or feeling of a participant were highlighted. Different colors were used to sort and categorize the highlighted phrases into meaningful codes.
    
    Coding could also follow different approaches; a priori and emergent coding (Reference: Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd Edition, Chapter 11. part 11.4.1). The main difference is whether one relies on past discoveries and theories while coding or not.
    
    A priori means that the coding is based on existing theories from previous research. 
    Emergent means that the coding is done without any theory that might guide your analysis. 
    The choice of which approach to follow can be challenging. In some cases they are used in combination with each other. 
    
    In this case, a combination was applied. 
    
    \subsubsection{3. Generating themes}
    
    When it comes to identifying themes among the tags, it can be done in two different ways. Latent (interpretive), which means that one has to interpret what one thinks the participant means by what it says. Semtanktik (explicit), which means to adhere to exactly what they say. A latent approach was followed as ...

    \subsubsection{4. Reviewing themes}
    \subsubsection{5. Defining and naming themes}
    \subsubsection{6. Presenting results}
    The presentation of qualitative data is varied. 
    Finding a meaningful way to present and describe the findings. 

Such analyzes, where interpretation of textual data is carried out, meet special considerations of validity (Reference: Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd Edition, Chapter 8. part 8.10.2.) If the study aims to present generalized findings, several researchers should be included in the analysis process. This to avoid the subjectivity that naturally arises when only one person is responsible for the analysis. The homogeneity and consensus between the independent analyzes will then be assessed, and in this way, inter-rater reliability can enhance the analysis.
