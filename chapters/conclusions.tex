\section{Final remarks}

\section{Concluding thoughts}
Målet med å finne ut noe om message framing ...
Ble heller en generell innnsiktsamling på hvordan oppleveseln av slike nudger er og potensiale. 

\section{Further research}

It would be interesting to do similar user experience studies concerning other types of digital nudges, to get a insights from the users perspectives. Of course, it could strengthen the findings if the study was rearranged but with controlled user groups, including both inactive and active participants.   

\subsection{Long-term effects}
It is known that studies regarding the long term effects is low for many HCI topics, including digital nudging. It would be extremely interesting to study this context in longer time interval, to see if this informational nudges had an impact over time. One of the participants actually expressed that "maybe over time, it would have a stronger effect on me".
